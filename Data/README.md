# Annotation with Dataset

File and Folder you might need:

- `Annotation`: folder with all annotations from students
- `EMG` and `IMU`: sensor datasets associated with videos
- `summary.csv`: A summary table of video information

You may ignore any other files in the archive.

All annotations from students are saved in the folder `Annotation`. EMG and IMU data are stored separately in their folder `EMG` and `IMU`. All files have unique prefix ID which can help you map annotation and datasets.

Please start your work from `summary.csv`, which contains video information (duration, number of frames, etc.) that help you convert frame numbers to millisecond time stamps in IMU and EMG data.

Because annotation files from different group are a little different in their formats and style, please pay attention and be tolerate when you process those files.

If you have any issue or problem, please let us know.
